F'EARTHA true type font by P.D. Magnuswww.fontmonkey.comF'Earth is the first TrueType font I ever designed. It's extrapolatedfrom the logo for a little game that was published in issue #1 of'Industry of Cool', a San Diego area zine. The logo was designed inFreehand and the font in PfaEdit. There are glyphs for almost allstandard keystrokes.This font is copyright 2002 by P.D. Magnus. 'F'Earth' and 'fontmonkey'are trademarks of P.D. Magnus.
